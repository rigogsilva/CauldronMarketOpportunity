    # When I Work and South American Market
    
    Chad Halvorson tried to open When I Work in 1998-1999 for the first time. His first attempt did not work due to the low number of people with Internet access.
    
    He tried it again in 2010, and he succeeded because the number of Internet users had grown substantially from 33,000,000 in 1998 (12% of the population) to 222,150,226 in 2010 (72% of the population).
    
    The same is happening to South America, where the economic growth comes with the increase number of Internet and mobile device users.
